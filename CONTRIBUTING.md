# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

If you wish to contribute to this repository, please fork this repository, make the desired changes, and open a Pull request to have your code reviewed and merged.

When adding new effects or updating them, upload a small video at 600px x 300px in the virtual environment with a description to the `effects/README.md`.  Later I think we will do something more elaborate to manage the plugins, but this will be the source of truth for now.
